# Predictive Modeling - Machine Learning Algorithms

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predictive modeling using various machine learning algorithms to classify data effectively. The dataset is processed through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and feature engineering** before applying different models for prediction.

## Dataset
- The project uses a structured dataset containing multiple features.
- Key steps include:
  - Handling missing values and duplicates.
  - Data transformation and encoding categorical variables.
  - Feature selection and engineering to improve model accuracy.

## Machine Learning Models Implemented
1. **Logistic Regression** - A baseline model for classification.
2. **Random Forest** - An ensemble method to improve accuracy and robustness.
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** - A powerful classification algorithm.
4. **AdaBoost** - A boosting algorithm to enhance model performance.

## Key Steps in the Project

### EDA & Preprocessing
- Data visualization, outlier detection, missing value imputation.

### Feature Engineering
- Creating new features, scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

### Model Training & Evaluation
- Training models and evaluating performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Optimizing models for better predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- **Machine Learning Models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, AdaBoost)
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** for implementation
