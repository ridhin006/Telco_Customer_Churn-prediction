Predictive Modeling - Machine Learning Algorithms

Project Overview

This project focuses on predictive modeling using various machine learning algorithms to classify data effectively. The dataset is processed through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and feature engineering before applying different models for prediction.

Dataset

The project uses a structured dataset containing multiple features.

Key steps include:

Handling missing values and duplicates.

Data transformation and encoding categorical variables.

Feature selection and engineering to improve model accuracy.

Machine Learning Models Implemented

Logistic Regression - A baseline model for classification.

Random Forest - An ensemble method to improve accuracy and robustness.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) - A powerful classification algorithm.

AdaBoost - A boosting algorithm to enhance model performance.
